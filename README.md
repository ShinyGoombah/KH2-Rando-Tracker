## About the Tracker

To use the tracker, you will just need to open the html file in the main folder. This is a work in progress, and I have many plans for it ahead, which are listed below.
If you have any feedback, please feel free to let me know, I will be happy to implement any ideas I am able to.

The big interest around this tracker is to help keep better track of how many checks per world someone has done.
Clicking a world will increase the number to the left underneath that world by one.
There will be an icon that appears on the world icon once all checks have been marked.

## What is/is not Included In Total Checks:
Currently, the total checks for each world assume that all settings are turned on, so data fights, absent sillouettes, cups in olympus, etc are all calculated in the total checks.
This is not permanent, and more information on that is below.

A note on a couple of the worlds. Hollow Bastion includes all checks in both Hollow Bastion and the Cavern of Rememberance. Disney Castle counts all checks in Timeless River.

The total checks for worlds does NOT include the following in it's count, because these items will only be randomized with other items in this same group:
	HP Increases
	MP Increases
	Drive Gauge Increases
	Accessory Slots
	Armor Slots
	
The tracker also does not count the three starting chests in the Garden of Assemblage as checks for Hollow Bastion.

## Current To Do List (Not in any particular order)

Configuration Section that includes:
	- Turning on and off total checks for
		Data Org
		Absent Sillhouttes
		Sephiroth
		Lingering Will
		Olympu Coliseum Cups
	- Including/Excluding specific worlds and promise charm

Make a toggle to increment found checks by x1 x5 x10 and auto complete to mark a world as cleared.

Add Sora's Levels to the bottom row.

Add a place to keep track of "Important Checks".
